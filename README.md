## Enemy Changes

- Beetle Family - The debuff BeetleJuice is now stackable, lasting 5 seconds, and each stack applied resets the timer of previous stacks.
- Beetle - now spit a small projectile at short range, similar to beetle queens, instead of headbutting. The projectile applies a stack of BeetleJuice.
- Beetle Guard - has a new ability that increases own armor and increases nearby allies' attack/move speed. Does not apply if ally already has buff.
- Beetle Queen - spit projectiles and acid pools apply BeetleJuice. BeetleWard now keep stacking BeetleJuice the longer you're inside of it.

- Lemurian - Bite now has a slight lunge

- Lesser Wisp - Fires more "bullets" (3 -> 6) but has the same damage
- Greater Wisp - credit cost reduced by half (200 -> 120) (brass contraptions cost 60 as a reference)

- Blind Pest - credit cost increased by 5 (15 -> 20) (wisps cost 10 as a reference)

- Imp - now throw 2 void spikes at a more distant range instead of slashing at close range

- Brass Contraption - new ability BuffBeam, makes 1 nearby Golem/BeetleQueen class (size) enemy invincible for a short time (cannot target other brass contraptions)

- Lunar Family - new debuff Helfire, non-stackable, lasting 10 seconds, non-lethal, burns 10% of your full combined HP (+shield) while preventing healing and regen
- Lunar Golem - new ability LunarShell, buffs self to have +100 armor and attacks inflict Helfire while buff is active
- Lunar Wisp - increased acceleration (15 -> 30) and move speed (18 -> 20), miniguns spin up at closer range, orb applies Helfire
